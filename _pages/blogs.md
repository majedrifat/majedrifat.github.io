## NEWS!
#### 2025
1. Paper accepted at  11th International Conference on Virtual Reality (ICVR) 
2. Paper accepted at Computer Vision for Automated Medical Diagnosis (CVAMD @ ICCV 2025) Oct.19, Honolulu, Hawai'i

#### 2024

1. Paper accepted at IEEE BigData 2024

Our paper “[Abdominal Trauma Detection Using Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10825833)” has been accepted for presentation at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData). Co‑authored by Md Majedul Islam and Prof. Jing Selena He, the work combines quantum transfer learning with classical models to improve the diagnosis of abdominal trauma from CT scans. We look forward to sharing our findings in December!

2. Paper accepted at ICMLA 2024
   
Our paper “[Quantum Machine Learning for Computer Vision: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10903340)" has been accepted for presentation at the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA). Co‑authored by Md Majedul Islam and Prof. Jing Selena He, this work surveys recent advances in quantum machine learning and their impact on computer‑vision tasks such as image segmentation and classification. We’re excited to present it later this year!
